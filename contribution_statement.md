In this collaborative project focused on sea surface temperature from satellite imagery, I was responsible for addressing question 5, which required reproducing graphs 2a, 2b, and 2c from the original paper. To accomplish this task, I developed the necessary code to process and visualize the satellite data, ensuring that the graphs were recreated accurately while adhering to the paper's methodology. I made significant progress on each of the graphs, refining the visualization techniques and ensuring the data was properly represented. Upon reaching a satisfactory stage of completion for each graph, I handed the remaining work to my teammate, Prasann, who continued the refinement process and finalized the graphs for inclusion in our project report. This collaboration ensured that the reproduced graphs were consistent with the original paper and that our collective understanding of the analysis was sound. Additionally, I took the initiative to review and evaluate the work completed for previous questions in the project. This allowed me to ensure that our project was accurate, consistent, and well-documented. By confirming that our project was aligned with the original paper's methods and findings, I contributed to the overall success and integrity of our team's reproduction effort.
